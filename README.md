# My file to experiment with the CNC 3018

Designed are created with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). I found it easier to use for 2D thinkgs as it is a simple SVG editor.

I converted the SVG to Gcode using [Easel](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/easel)

I then run the job using [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle).

> [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) + [Easel](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/easel) + [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle) is the perfect beginer stack in my opinion
