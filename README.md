# My file to experiment with the CNC 3018



## The beginner stack

> [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) + [Easel](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/easel) + [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle) is the perfect beginer stack in my opinion

Designed are created with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). I found it easier to use for 2D thinkgs as it is a simple SVG editor.

I converted the SVG to Gcode using [Easel](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/easel)

I then run the job using [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle).

# The intermediary Stack

> [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) + [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) + [bCNC](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC) is the perfect intermedate stack in my opinion

Images/Log are created with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It is a easiway to conver complicated things into vector images

Convert the SVG files into gCode using [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/). This is a true CAD software you you can visualise you work in 3D and have a lot of function to create path for your CNC.

[bCNC](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC) run on a raspberry py so I don't need to have a dedicated computer for my CNC. I can simply have a all in one septy thanks to the Pi.
